# Health Impacts of Air Pollution

## PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)
Exposure to fine particles can cause short-term health effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath. Exposure to fine particles can also affect lung function and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease.

## CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)
High levels of CO2 in indoor environments can lead to drowsiness, headaches, and poor concentration. Extremely high levels can cause dizziness and confusion.

## Temperature
High temperatures can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, especially in vulnerable populations like the elderly and children.
